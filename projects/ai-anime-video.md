    <p class="project-description">
        This project focuses on creating an AI-powered system to generate anime-style illustration videos from narrated transcripts. The goal is to produce engaging, high-quality visuals that complement the audio narration, overcoming limitations of existing AI video generation tools.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Contributions & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Model Selection and Testing:</strong> Evaluated and tested multiple pre-trained AI models to identify the best options for generating anime-style visuals. This involved assessing the quality, consistency, and artistic style of the generated output.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcoming Video Length Limitations:</strong> Addressed the common limitation of short (e.g., 2-second) video clips generated by AI models. Implemented cinematic techniques like panning, zooming, and tilting to create the illusion of longer, more dynamic scenes from short clips.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Editing and Composition:</strong> Merged and edited the AI-generated clips into a cohesive 2-minute final video. This included creating smooth transitions, synchronizing visuals with the narration, and ensuring a consistent artistic style.</li>
        <li><strong>Resolution Enhancement and Upscaling:</strong> Enhanced the resolution of the initial low-quality GIF outputs to HD or 4K resolution, resulting in a high-quality final product suitable for viewing on larger screens.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="challenge-solution">
                <strong>Short Video Clip Lengths:</strong> AI video generation models often produce very short clips (around 2 seconds), making it difficult to create a continuous and engaging narrative.
                <span class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Employed cinematic techniques (panning, zooming, tilting) on the short clips to simulate camera movement and create the illusion of longer, more dynamic scenes. This effectively extended the perceived duration of the generated content.

                <strong>Low Initial Resolution of Generated Content:</strong> AI models often generate low-resolution outputs (e.g., GIFs), which are not suitable for high-quality video.
                <span class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Utilized AI-powered upscaling tools (e.g., Topaz Video AI, Waifu2x, or similar) to enhance the resolution of the generated clips to HD or 4K, resulting in a significantly improved visual quality.
