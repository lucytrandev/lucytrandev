    <p className="project-description">
        As part of a team in the AngelHack 48H global hackathon, I contributed to the development of an AI-powered tool to analyze Heineken's marketing campaigns. The hackathon involved over 200 developers from India, Singapore, Vietnam, Korea, and China. Our tool focused on using object detection (YOLOv8) to identify and count beer products (Heineken and competitors) and leveraging a Large Language and Vision Assistant (LAVA) for sentiment analysis to assess customer satisfaction and promotional staff efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2 className="section-heading">Key Contributions & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Object Detection Model Training (YOLOv8):</strong> Collaborated in labeling over 1,000 images to create a training dataset for YOLOv8. Trained the YOLOv8 model to detect and count Heineken beer products and those of competitors in images, providing insights into product visibility and market presence.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis with LAVA:</strong> Utilized LAVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant) to perform sentiment analysis on images and associated text (if available) from the marketing campaign. This helped assess customer satisfaction levels and the effectiveness of promotional staff interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>UI and Dashboard Development:</strong> Contributed to the development of a user interface and dashboard to allow users to upload images and visualize the campaign analysis results. This provided a user-friendly way to interact with the AI tool and gain insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <div className="challenge-solution">
                <strong>Rapid Data Labeling:</strong> Labeling a large dataset (1,000+ images) within the 48-hour hackathon timeframe was a significant challenge.
                <span className="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Efficiently divided the labeling tasks among team members. Used streamlined annotation tools and techniques to accelerate the process. Focused on labeling the most relevant objects (beer products) accurately.

        <li>
            <div className="challenge-solution">
                <strong>Integrating YOLOv8 and LAVA:</strong> Combining the outputs of the object detection model (YOLOv8) and the sentiment analysis model (LAVA) to provide a holistic campaign analysis.
                <span className="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a pipeline to process images through both models and combine their results. For example, detected objects could be used as context for the sentiment analysis performed by LAVA.
