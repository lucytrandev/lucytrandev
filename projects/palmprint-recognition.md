        This project focuses on developing a palmprint recognition system using a self-supervised learning approach, inspired by SimCLR, to address the common challenge of limited labeled data in biometric identification. The system leverages contrastive learning with a ResNet-18 backbone, comprehensive image preprocessing with OpenCV, and a Streamlit UI for real-time demonstration.

                <strong>Choosing Appropriate Augmentations:</strong> Selecting the right data augmentations for contrastive learning is crucial for performance.
                <span class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Experimented with a range of image augmentations (e.g., rotations, crops, color jittering) and carefully selected a combination that promoted the learning of invariant features while preserving essential palmprint details. Referenced the SimCLR paper and related research for best practices.
