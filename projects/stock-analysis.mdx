    <p className="project-description">
        This project aims to develop a comprehensive stock analysis system, initially focusing on single-stock technical analysis (Phase 1).  The system is designed to provide insights into stock trends, generate trading signals, assess risk, and ultimately aid in identifying profitable trading opportunities.  The project encompasses data acquisition, processing, technical indicator calculation, AI-powered prediction, and a user interface for visualization and interaction. The long-term vision includes incorporating "Big Player" (BP) activity analysis, market maker (MM) strategies, and portfolio optimization.

    <h2 className="section-heading">Key Contributions & Impact (Phase 1 Focus)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Data Acquisition and Management:</strong>
            Implemented a robust data pipeline to retrieve historical stock data (OHLCV) from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.  Established a SQLite database for efficient storage and retrieval of stock data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Technical Indicator Calculation:</strong>
            Developed functions to calculate a range of essential technical indicators, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</li>
                <li>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</li>
                <li>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)</li>
                <li>Relative Strength Index (RSI)</li>
                <li>Volume-related metrics</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Trend Determination and Signal Generation:</strong>
            Implemented rule-based logic to determine the current market trend (uptrend, downtrend, sideways) and generate corresponding buy/sell/hold signals based on the calculated technical indicators.  This included defining specific thresholds and conditions for signal generation (e.g., SMA crossovers, RSI levels).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>AI-Powered Prediction:</strong>
            Developed and trained an AI model (using Scikit-learn/TensorFlow/PyTorch) to predict future price movements and enhance trading signals. The AI model outputs:
            <ul>
                <li>Predicted Percentage Change (for 1D, 3D, 5D, 2W, 1M, 3M horizons)</li>
                <li>Trend Classification (uptrend, downtrend, sideways)</li>
                <li>AI-driven Trade Signals (Buy/Sell/Hold)</li>
                <li>AI Signal Confidence</li>
                <li>Trend Strength Score (AI)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Risk Metric Calculation:</strong>
            Implemented functions to calculate key risk metrics, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Historical Volatility</li>
                <li>Maximum Drawdown</li>
                <li>Beta</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Back-end Development:</strong>
            Built a modular back-end system to handle data processing, indicator calculations, AI model predictions, and risk assessment. The back-end provides structured data outputs for use by the UI and other planned modules.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>UI Development (Preliminary):</strong>
            Created a basic user interface (using [Your Chosen UI Framework]) to:
            <ul>
                <li>Input stock ticker symbols and date ranges.</li>
                <li>Display historical price charts and calculated indicators.</li>
                <li>Visualize trend analysis and trading signals.</li>
                <li>Present risk metrics.</li>
                <li>*(Planned) Display a ranked list of stocks based on analysis.*</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2 className="section-heading">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
