    <p class="project-description">
        As a Software Engineer at SMA LLC, I collaborated with Quest (quest.com) to develop and integrate database
        monitoring features into their Foglight platform. My work focused on both front-end (Angular) and back-end
        (Java) development, encompassing database setup, monitoring UI design, API integration, and AWS automation for
        various database types, including AWS DocumentDB, SAP HANA, and MongoDB Atlas.
    </p>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Key Contributions & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Setup and Configuration:</strong> Configured and managed single-host and multi-host (Replica Set, Clustered) DocumentDB instances on AWS. Deployed and configured multi-host SAP HANA systems (Scale-Out, System Replication) on AWS Linux using command-line tools. Worked with MongoDB Atlas, a fully managed cloud database service. This foundational work was essential for developing and testing the monitoring capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring UI Development (Angular):</strong> Designed and developed user-friendly and responsive monitoring dashboards using Angular for all supported database types. This involved creating interactive visualizations of key database metrics, implementing real-time data updates, and adhering to responsive design principles.</li>
        <li><strong>API Integration (Java):</strong> Integrated the Angular front-end with back-end APIs (developed in Java) to retrieve and display real-time database metrics, performance data, and status information. This ensured seamless communication between the UI and the underlying database systems.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Automation (Lambda):</strong> Developed AWS Lambda functions to automate the management of database instances, specifically implementing scheduled start/stop functionality to optimize costs. This demonstrated an understanding of cloud resource management and cost optimization strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-End Development (Java):</strong> Developed back-end services in Java to support the monitoring and management of the various database types. This included data collection, processing, and API endpoints for the front-end.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="section-heading">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="challenge-solution">
                <strong>Diverse Database Technologies:</strong> Working with a variety of database technologies (DocumentDB, SAP HANA, MongoDB Atlas), each with its own unique characteristics and management requirements.
                <span class="solution">
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Invested time in learning the specifics of each database technology, including their configuration, and best practices.
