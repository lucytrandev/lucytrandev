    <p className="project-description">
        As a Software Engineer at NTT DATA, I contributed to the development and maintenance of a charging station
        management system. My responsibilities spanned both front-end (AngularJS) and back-end (Java, JAX-RS/WS)
        development, including implementing the OCPP protocol, building REST APIs, creating background tasks, and
        writing automated tests.
    </p>

    <h2 className="section-heading">Key Contributions & Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>OCPP Protocol Implementation:</strong> Researched and implemented the Open Charge Point Protocol
            (OCPP) to enable communication and control between the charging stations and the central management system.
            This was crucial for interoperability and standardized management of the charging infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Front-End Development (AngularJS):</strong> Developed and maintained the user interface (UI) of the
            charging station management system using AngularJS. This involved creating interactive components, handling
            user input, and displaying real-time data from the charging stations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>REST API Development (Java, JAX-RS/WS):</strong> Built RESTful APIs using Java and JAX-RS/WS to
            provide the necessary back-end functionality for the system. These APIs handled communication between the
            UI, the charging stations (via OCPP), and other system components.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Back-End Development (Java):</strong> Developed background tasks and services in Java to automate
            various processes within the system, such as data synchronization, reporting, and system monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Wrote automation tests to ensure the reliability, performance, and
            stability of both the front-end and back-end components of the system. This contributed to a higher quality
            product and reduced the risk of regressions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Task Management and Collaboration:</strong> Effectively broke down large, complex tasks into
            smaller, manageable units. Collaborated with other team members to deliver tasks and ensure project
            alignment.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="section-heading">Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div className="challenge-solution">
                <strong>Learning and Implementing OCPP:</strong> The OCPP protocol was a new technology for me,
                requiring significant research and understanding to implement correctly.
                <span className="solution">
      <strong>Solution:</strong>  Dedicated time to thoroughly study the OCPP specification and related documentation.  Collaborated with colleagues who had experience with similar protocols to accelerate the learning process.  Utilized online resources and forums to troubleshoot issues and find best practices.

    </ul>

    <h2 className="section-heading">Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Deep Understanding of OCPP:</strong> Gained in-depth knowledge of the OCPP protocol and its
            application in charging station management.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Full-Stack Development Experience:</strong> Enhanced my skills in both front-end (AngularJS) and
            back-end (Java) development, including API design and integration.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Importance of Automated Testing:</strong> Reinforced the value of automated testing in ensuring
            software quality and reducing the risk of regressions.
